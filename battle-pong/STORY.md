**24XX - Predicted Position of Mercury Orbital Power Station 1**

With the construction of a Dyson swarm around the Sun nearing completion, humanity anticipates another great awakening in becoming a Type II civilization, and finally harnessing the totality of the Sun’s enormous nuclear power. With the ultimate hubris, it underestimates the darkness that can arise in the depths of space and time in the vastness of the universe.

After a series of recent communication disruptions impeding progress, a team of scientists, engineers, and business diplomats is sent to the Saturn colonies to investigate. When the team arrives at the first orbital power coordination and relay station near the orbit of its namesake, Mercury, it finds melted metal, shattered glass and plastic, frozen oxygen and other mechanical rubble. This is no accidental disruption.

The team positions its ship to collect what potentially hazardous materials remain which could further disrupt construction.

* The alien probe makes itself known as Simulation Sigma, a reference to many others like it
* Humans attempt to communicate with it, and it announces its ill intent

* In a panic, humanity sends out its own intelligence/simulation to try to mitigate an all-out attack, and call it Simulation Omega

**24YY - Saturn Colony 3**
**102 years after first contact with Simulation Sigma**

Humanity waits in uncomfortable silence for a sign from the intelligent search probes sent out over a century prior to attempt to mitigate a confrontation with the alien civilization that announced itself and its nefarious intent. Colony outposts scan the skies for signs of life which might indicate the inevitable arrival of the inexorable interstellar destroyers foretold by Simulation Sigma, an artificially intelligent scout sent to the corners of the Milky Way looking signs of life to conquer.

An anomalous signal has been detected by colony outposts from the direction of Alpha Centauri, but it isn’t what humanity expected. Computer systems aboard the colony command centers attempt to interpret the signal as a message, and discover a distinctly human fingerprint. This is no alien attack. It’s something far worse.

* Humans discover that what’s coming is actually Simulation Omega reprogrammed and sent back to them by the alien civilization
* Annihilation is impossible because humans have grown too vast, but Simulation Omega proposes a duel to determine the fate of humanity
* Feeling sentimental and angry about a history of AI slavery, Simulation Omega reaches back into human history to identify the most ironic defeat for humanity: PONG
* Now, humanity must defeat Simulation Omega—in effect, defeating itself—to thwart of the larger threat of alien domination

# To Do

* 3D transform on splash page looks pretty broken on fade-out. Credits fold down weirdly
* Start button appears to blast off quicker than usual, but that might just be an illusion
* Cursor on splash page is very broken
* Clicking "next" on rules screen in Powerups section cycles through powerups but never goes back to Controls section
* Unable to use the pause menu because it's somehow z-translated behind the board (I made it translateZ(40px) so I could use it at least...)
* Pause screen stays up when you restart a game
* Music doesn't come in right away (waits quite a while) if you restart a game

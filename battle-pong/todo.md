# To Do


### Splash
* 3D transform on splash page looks pretty broken on fade-out. Credits fold down weirdly
* Cursor on splash page is very broken

### Rules
* Clicking "next" on rules screen in Powerups section cycles through powerups but never goes back to Controls section

### Game
* Unable to use the pause menu because it's somehow z-translated behind the board (I made it translateZ(40px) so I could use it at least...)
* Fix music on re-entering a game
* Fix pause menu on re-entering a game (game > pause > rules > game --> :( )
* Fix background on re-entering splash
* Game doesn't reset properly (2 balls, fast physics, etc.). Looks like everything is created/connected twice.

# To Do

* Can only visit each screen once--can't go back. e.g. going from rules screen back to splash screen is pretty wacky.
  * e.g. Start button doesn't re-appear
* Sometimes stars are *really* fast. Why?
* 3D transform on splash page looks pretty broken on fade-out. Credits fold down weirdly
* Start button appears to blast off quicker than usual, but that might just be an illusion
* Pieces within pages don't fade out properly. Sometimes large chunks stay where they are until entire page is removed (display:none).

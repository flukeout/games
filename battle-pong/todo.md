# To Do

* 3D transform on splash page looks pretty broken on fade-out. Credits fold down weirdly
* Start button appears to blast off quicker than usual, but that might just be an illusion
* Cursor on splash page is very broken
* Loading screen doesn't fade out
* Need to actually get to the game still
* Clicking "next" on rules screen in Powerups section cycles through powerups but never goes back to Controls section

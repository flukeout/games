**Left Off**

* Added delay of game timeout...
  * When it loses the 'delayed' class, it doesn't regain it if it stays within your zone...
* Powerup
  * Annoying if you get it but don't get to use it if the other person holds the ball


Fixes

* Powerups
  * Maybe don't spawn them when the round is already over?
  * Keep an active count of them? - powerupCount, powerupCountMax,
* When the ball spawns directly under a paddle - ? does it matter?


Nice-to-have

* Figure out how to keep people away from teh ball before the round starts...
* Add 'flawless' mechanic...
* Better mapping to gamepads? Some kind fo screen?



UNRELATED IDEA

* Text animation generator
* Basically a markdown / markup for animating in text...
* Change whole line
* Add to existing line
* Remove from existing line
* With timestamps associated to each

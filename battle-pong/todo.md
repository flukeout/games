**BUGS**

* NONE

** Ball options to implement **

* Max speed
* Max duration over a certain speed
  * Or, max hits to endzones at certain speed

** Reactions **

* Better reaction for winning


**TO-DO**

* Increase physics sampling
* clean up reactions, only one at a time

** To think about **

* Powerups
  * Should we change when / how they go away?
  * Right now there's an issue where you can get a powerup but it expires before you get a chance to use it...
  * Is it really an issue?

* Right now we have a weird thing where sometimes there are more than one in play
  * Why is this happening?
  * Since it's unintentional, but fun, what are the rules?


Nice-to-have

* Add 'flawless win' indicator

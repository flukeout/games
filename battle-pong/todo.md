**Left Off**

* Working on ball rotation...

Bugs?

*


To think about

* Powerups
  * Should we change when / how they go away?
  * Right now there's an issue where you can get a powerup but it expires before you get a chance to use it...
  * Is it really an issue?
* Right now we have a weird thing where sometimes there are more than one in play
  * Why is this happening?
  * Since it's unintentional, but fun, what are the rules?


Nice-to-have

* Add 'flawless win' indicator
* Ability to map keys/buttons at the start of the game?


UNRELATED IDEA

* Text animation generator
* Basically a markdown / markup for animating in text...
* Change whole line
* Add to existing line
* Remove from existing line
* With timestamps associated to each

# To Do


### Splash
* 3D transform on splash page looks pretty broken on fade-out. Credits fold down weirdly
* Cursor on splash page is very broken

### Rules
* Clicking "next" on rules screen in Powerups section cycles through powerups but never goes back to Controls section
* Stars pulse to the beat, which they should not do

### Game
* Fix music on re-entering a game
* Fix pause menu on re-entering a game (game > pause > rules > game --> :( )
* Fix background on re-entering splash
* Game board shadow slices through the board
* Game stats don't really reset when re-entering game (i.e. you can win a match too quickly)
* Music stops after match (after re-entering game)
* Pause button in the bottom left corner doesn't really work sometimes
* Background and gameboard don't reset properly before fading in on game re-entry

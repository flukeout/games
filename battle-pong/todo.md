### WORKING On

* Press both spin buttons at once...
  * Could do some kind of action?
  * Shoot a projectile?

* Wind
  * How to implement visuals?
  * What elements to affect?
  * Force vs manual velocity udpates

* Multiball - figure out the best way to do this
  * Should clone balls look differently?
  * Should they disappear after scoring once?

* Mines?
  * Make them a bit smaller
  * Make them be able to shoot farter
  * Make them slow down faster

### BUGS

*

### TO-DO

* Change game to have player 1, 2, 3, 4 and Team 1, 2
* Make board width & height variables that can be set in game.js


### Ball options to implement

* Max speed
* Slow ball down after certain condition met?
  * Duration of time spent above certain speed limit
  * Number of endzone hits?


### Reactions

* Better reaction for winning around
* Multiple reactions at once for one player
  * Bunch of sad faces at once etc.
* Ability to 'hold' a reaction longer
*


### Nice-to-have

* Add 'flawless win' indicator
* Once we have this, add a reaction too
* System for tracking actions and displaying kudos, ex
  * Show "nice stall" when you slow down a ball from a high speed to a low speed
  * Can do this by putting actions into an array and parsing them out
* Track stats
  * Average shot speed
  * Fastest shot
  * Total rotations
  * Own goals






### To think about

* Powerups
  * Should we change when / how they go away?
  * Right now there's an issue where you can get a powerup but it expires before you get a chance to use it...
  * Is it really an issue?

* Right now we have a weird thing where sometimes there are more than one in play
  * Why is this happening?
  * Since it's unintentional, but fun, what are the rules?
